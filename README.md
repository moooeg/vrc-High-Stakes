# Frij 75477M
This repository contains team 75477M's code for the [2024-2025 High Stakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx6HJSpopeQ) season of the VEX robotics competition.

Having the code in a git remote allows us to collaborate as a team easily as everyone has access to the codebase and any changes can immediately be reflected across all our devices. 

#### Programming Info
- Frij's code uses purely Python. You can find the wiring guide at the top of main.py for the brain's port configuration.
- Our program includes a selection screen for easily selecting autonomous code suited for each starting position.
- Code in this repository is similar to our code used last year for Over Under. Last year's code can be found [in a seperate repo](https://github.com/peterdev22/vrc-over-under).

## Frij @ Australian Nationals
#### Mechanical Systems
- 7 motor drivetrain (6×11W, 2×5.5W) at 333 RPM
- 1 motor intake at 600 RPM
- PTO to switch 2 drivetrain motors to a 6-bar lift
- Pneumatics (2 air canisters)
  - 1 cylinder PTO
  - 1 cylinder paddle
  - 2 cylinder goal clamp
  - 2 cylinder elevation hook
 
#### Automatic Systems
- Ring colour sorting using a colour and distance sensor
- Auto ring redirect (into lift) using a distance sensor
- Auto goal clamping using a distance sensor

## Frij @ VEX Worlds
#### Mechanical Systems
- 6 motor drivetrain (6×11W) at 333 RPM
- 2 motor dual-stage intake
- PTO to switch 2 drivetrain motors to a 'lady brown' lift
- Passive tier 1 elevation
- Pneumatics (2 air canisters)
  - 1 cylinder PTO
  - 1 cylinder paddle
  - 1 cylinder intake lift
  - 2 cylinder goal clamp

#### Automatic Systems
- Odometry + inertial sensors for autonomous
- Rotation sensor for 'lady brown' positioning
